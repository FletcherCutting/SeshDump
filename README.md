# SeshDump

SeshDump is a Windows tool that when executed will retrieve information about the operating environment and save to file.

SeshDump is designed to be simple, lightweight, and able to be deployed at scale.

Currently, SeshDump is in its early alpha stages with the following limited functionality:
- Retrieve list of PIDs from running processes
- Retrieve running process executable paths
- Retrieve user SIDs of running processes
- Retrieve usernames of running processes
- Retrieve command line arguments of running processes
- Export retrieved data in XML or JSON form

Key features soon to come:
- Export to different session folders
- Retrieve registry keys
- Retrieve local users
- Retrieve Windows services
- Retrieve Windows scheduled tasks
